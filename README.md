# <img src="assets/pot.ico" width="50" /> `stove` - an editor for cooked unreal engine 4 maps

*<h1 align="center">still an extremely heavy work in progress</h1>*

<details>
<summary><h1 align="center">Roadmap</h1></summary>

### Basic functionality
- [x] save and open unreal map files of any version
- [x] display a selectable list of actors
- [x] allow editing all of an actor's transforms
- [x] render each actor as a cube/sprite in a 3d scene
- [x] walk around the scene with an unreal-editor-style camera
- [x] duplicate actors in the same map
- [x] transplant actors from a different map
- [x] edit the properties of actors and their components
- [ ] insert default values (properties left as default are cut from the map)
### Convenience
- [ ] undo and redo any action
- [ ] actor deletion
- [ ] can move actors in the viewport instead of in the properties
- [ ] multiple selection (requires above to be useful)
- [ ] searching functionality
### Low Priority
- [ ] display the mesh/sprite of an actor and their components rather than a cube
- [x] discord RPC (show your internet friends what you're doing)
